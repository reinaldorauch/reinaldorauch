### Hi, im [Reinaldo](https://reinaldorauch.github.io) ###

I'm a programmer primary for the web but dwelling in many places of the 
programming world. I'm primally a JS/TS and PHP developer, but I can write Rust,
SQL, CSS, Ruby, Python, Flutter (Dart), C, C++, even Delphi (Object Pascal)
if needed.

Currently, besides work, I'm father of my little girl Marjorie <3 and i'm
interested in contributing to the [OpenLoco](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco)
project, and contributing to opensource in general.

Im at all the networks as @reinaldorauch
